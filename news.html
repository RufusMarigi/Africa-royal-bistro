            This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn
        >. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually
        vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the
        target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
        <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
        <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Next month, we will be serving
        <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat
        at the chef table, contact us before

      <h2>Ugali and its nutrition benefits</h2>
      <header>

        Ugali is Kenya&#8217;s staple food. For most of us, ugali is a source of
        energy. When we are famished, we will ask for ugali. I also like ugali
        because it fills me quickly and for a long time. But that is not all
        that ugali has to offer. Today We will look at the nutrition benefits of
        ugali.
        <br />
        Carbohydrate is a major source of energy for the body. The body absorbs
        carbohydrates differently depending on the type of ugali. Carbohydrates
        from whole grain ugali have a low glycaemic index. They are therefore
        absorbed slowly. This keeps you full for long. It also helps to prevent
        obesity as well as manage diabetes. This ugali is therefore the best not
        only for people with diabetes but for everyone. <br />
        Vitamin B is a complex of 8 vitamins. Ugali is a good source of
        B-vitamins especially Thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), and Niacin (B3). It
        also contains some Folate (B9) which is needed especially by pregnant
        women. The B-vitamins in ugali helps our bodies to use energy well. They
        also contribute to healthy skin, heart, proper brain function and
        prevention of dementia, proper digestion, and healthy hair and nails.

        Next month we will be serving Ugali with Sukuma Wiki. To reserve a seat
